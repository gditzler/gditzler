### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an experienced career scientist with a background in machine learning. I enjoy applying mathematics, statistics, and machine learning to solve real-world problems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on research areas related to continual/lifelong learning, adversarial machine learning, learning in nonstationary environments, and applications of machine learning. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m teaching myself reinforcement learning and occasionally dabble in [JuliaLang](https://julialang.org/). 
- ðŸ‘¯ I love collaborating with people in applied areas to integrate machine learning approaches to address their challenges. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His
